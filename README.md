# Omicron Windows
Unity's UI window display system. Natively supports overlapped windows culling, window appearance and disappearance animations.

# Installation
Omicron Windows is the upm package, so the install is similar to other upm packages:
1. Open `Window/PackageManager`
2. Click `+` in the right corner and select `Add package from git url...`
3. Paste link to this package `https://github.com/Anton-Notna/OmicronconWindows.git` and click `Add`

# Usage
I'm too lazy to write any further....
